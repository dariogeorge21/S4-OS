# /proc filesystem

## Aim: Use /proc file system to gather basic information about your machine:

- Number of CPU cores
- Total memory and the fraction of free memory
- Number of processes currently running
- Number of processes in the running and blocked states
- Number of processes forked since the last bootup. How do you compare this value with the question above?
- The number of context switches performed since the last bootup for a particular process.
