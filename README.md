# S4-OS: Operating Systems Learning Repository

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for **Operating Systems** concepts and lab work during the fourth semester of engineering. It contains theoretical documentation, practical implementations, and lab assignments to help understand the fundamental principles of operating systems.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand core operating system concepts and architecture
- Learn process and memory management techniques
- Explore file systems and I/O management
- Study CPU scheduling algorithms
- Understand synchronization, deadlocks, and their solutions
- Gain hands-on experience through practical lab work

## 📖 Repository Structure

### Documentation
- **[OS_Documentation.md](OS_Documentation.md)**: Comprehensive guide covering all fundamental OS concepts including:
  - Introduction to Operating Systems
  - Process and Memory Management
  - File System Management
  - I/O Management
  - Scheduling Algorithms
  - Deadlocks and Synchronization
  - And much more...

### Lab Work
This section will contain practical implementations and experiments:
- Process management programs
- Scheduling algorithm simulations
- Memory management implementations
- File system operations
- Synchronization problems and solutions
- Inter-process communication examples

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the Documentation**: Start with [OS_Documentation.md](OS_Documentation.md) to understand theoretical concepts
2. **Explore Lab Work**: Practice concepts through hands-on lab assignments
3. **Experiment**: Modify and extend the examples to deepen your understanding

## 📝 Topics Covered

- **Operating System Fundamentals**: Architecture, types, and functions
- **Process Management**: Process lifecycle, PCB, context switching
- **CPU Scheduling**: FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin, and multilevel queue scheduling
- **Memory Management**: Paging, segmentation, virtual memory, page replacement
- **File Systems**: File operations, directory structures, allocation methods
- **I/O Management**: Hardware, methods, and scheduling
- **Synchronization**: Critical section, semaphores, monitors, classical problems
- **Deadlocks**: Detection, prevention, avoidance, and recovery

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

Programs and implementations will primarily use:
- C programming language (for system-level programming)
- Shell scripting (for automation and demonstrations)
- Linux/Unix environment (for practical OS exploration)

## 📚 Recommended Resources

- *Operating System Concepts* by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne
- *Modern Operating Systems* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum
- Linux kernel documentation
- POSIX standards
